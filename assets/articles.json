The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's home and kept his family on edge. \"The accuracy is phenomenal,\" Albert Clemens, Sr. said. \"Because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door.\" Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- <b>sometimes more than once a day</b> -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front door. Clemens and police believe the eggs are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. \"Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,\" Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They've spent a year doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- which is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a young man across the street who confronted him a couple years ago and asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed this thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone door to door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. \"The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,\" Houser said. \"I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.\" The guilty parties don't appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One hit him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department, which has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. \"The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,\" Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. \"We're not going to let it go,\" Houser said. \"We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure something out.\" Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never consider moving from his beloved home. \"I like the neighborhood,\" Clemens said. \"I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house -- but it's been kind of a nightmare.\"","views":73,"desc":"Fifth attempt to make the CreaEdit hybrid model work, wish me luck.","tags":"Test,Fifth,Lets,Goooo","pathToImg":"https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/270000/nahled/job-workemployeebusiness-manco.jpg","dateMade":"2021-04-23T19:48:42.993Z","lastMod":"2021-04-23T19:48:42.997Z","author":null},{"nameTag":"Fifth Time or Bust","subtitle":"The 2021 Remaster of the Hit 2006 Remake of 1999's Reshooting of \"Please let this work, I don't have this kind of time -- Remastered\"'s Re-release to Blu-ray","likes":3,"imgCap":"Such a Lovely Photo, oh wow","content":"<h2>Artist's Statement, <small class=\"text-muted\">April 4, 2000</small></h2>\nIt began in December 1994, when the Lehman College Art Gallery and its director, Susan Hoeltzel, commissioned <i>The World’s First Collaborative Sentence</i> as part of “InterActions,” a survey of Douglas Davis’ early work (1967-81) in a variety of media, from drawing, printmaking, and photography to performance, videotapes, and live satellite television broadcasting. Using a server provided by the City University of New York (CUNY)—and working closely with professor Robert Schneider in the department of mathematics at Lehman College—Davis documented the exhibition on the Web and created an entirely new work linked to the exhibition’s theme.\n\nUnveiled on December 7, 1994, the site was linked to a live performance in the Lehman College Art Gallery. Artist Nathalie Novarina, participating in the performance via phone from Geneva, supplied the <i>Sentence</i>'s maiden image and its first words. In collaboration with Gary Welz, Davis designed the formal interactive structure of the <i>Sentence</i>.\n\nIn January 1995, Barbara and the late Eugene M. Schwartz purchased both the concept of the <i>Sentence</i> and the site itself. As a symbol of ownership, the Schwartzes received a disk that recorded the first days of the site, including the earliest contributions. The Schwartzes' generosity allowed further work to be done on the design of the <i>Sentence</i> as well as a revision of the introductory homepage that adds information about the meaning and intention of the work. Professor Schneider has maintained the <i>Sentence</i> on the Web for over ten years, breaking up the enormous volume of contributions into separate \"chapters\" (there are now twenty-one). Susan Hoeltzel, moreover, has actively encouraged the evolution of the <i>Sentence</i> at every step. The work was included in several interactive installations—at the Kwangju Biennale in Korea in 1995, at the School of Visual Arts' \"Digital Salon\" exhibition later that year (which toured internationally), and in 1999 at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie (ZKM) in Karlsruhe, Germany (as part of the exhibition \"net.condition\")—all of which attracted thousands of online contributions.\n\nIn 1995, Mrs. Schwartz donated the <i>Sentence</i> to the Whitney Museum of American Art. Davis commemorated the Whitney's acquisition of the <i>Sentence</i> by designing, with Vincent M. Spina, a logo—W-M Music—which now lives among the year 2000 contributions to the<i>Sentence</i> itself. W-M stands for \"Wrap Music,\" a series of audio files that includes conceptual song making and historic sounds sent to the <i>Sentence</i> in its earliest days.\n\nFrom its inception, the <i>Sentence</i> has received a torrent of words, sounds, and images , contributors having learned about the site by word-of-mouth, web-based references, or press attention. The appeal of the <i>Sentence</i> is that it gives the world a space in which to speak its collective and its individual mind.*\n\nAs of early 2000, the estimated number of actual contributions neared <b>200,000</b> and incorporated dozens of languages. The only \"rule\" of the <i>Sentence</i> is that no one is allowed to type a period at the end of their contributions. Though ingenious users have occasionally found ways to break this rule, the vast majority have abided by it with great passion, criticizing those who discover ways to type a period at the end of a grammatically completed thought. The <i>Sentence</i> may well go on forever, or at least until a superior force or the limitations of web technology calls a halt to it.\n\nAs the skills of users have increased, the <i>Sentence</i> has grown to incorporate far more than words. In addition to texts, there are now photographs, video, sounds, graphics, and links to thousands of other websites, contributed by people of all ages and cultures. Among the contributions are musings, rants, lyrical poems, political and spiritual tracts, fragments of thought, and philosophical speculation, as well as occasional vulgarities. They address such concerns as art, literature, sexuality, religion, the nature of play, the meaning of the \"sentence\" itself, and the vaster subjects of life and death.\n\nDouglas Davis is grateful to all those who are writing and designing the <i>Sentence</i> and regards them as fully equal collaborators. He also thanks the original sponsors of the Sentence at the Lehman College Art Gallery, the students of Lehman college, and Barbara and the late Eugene M. Schwartz.\n<br>\n<br>\n<figure class = \"card p-2\">\n  <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n    <p>The <i>Sentence</i> has no end. Sometimes I think it had no beginning.
